# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As Modmail is currently under active development with no official releases, 
the current dev state is supported security wise. Please do not remain on old 
versions long, as that may make contributing difficult.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities here on discord using the 
"report security vulnerability" flow. As this is active development, expect
a response within a week or two. If it has gone longer than that, or you can 
see this and are sure the report-this flow is nonfunctional, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/3f7jBUXdxw)
and ping the Devs so we can fix that.
